# PowerDisplay — Per-Feature VCP Code Resolution & Persistence

Design spec. Date: 2026-06-30. Branch: `yuleng/powerdisplay/vcp-code-resolution/1`.

## 1. Problem

Each PowerDisplay feature (brightness, contrast, volume, color temperature, input
source, power state) is currently bound to **exactly one hardcoded VCP code**
(`NativeConstants.cs`: brightness `0x10`, contrast `0x12`, volume `0x62`, color
preset `0x14`, input source `0x60`, power mode `0xD6`). `DdcCiController` uses these
constants verbatim in its `Get*/Set*/Initialize*` methods.

In reality a single logical feature can map to **different VCP codes on different
monitors**. The canonical case is brightness: most monitors expose it on `0x10`
(Luminance), but some expose only `0x13` (Backlight Control) or `0x6B`
(Backlight Level: White). With a single hardcoded code these monitors appear to not
support the feature.

We need a mechanism where, for each feature, we define an **ordered list of candidate
VCP codes by priority**, then **resolve** which code a given monitor actually uses,
**persist** that decision per monitor (so we never re-probe needlessly — including a
"checked, none supported" sentinel), and **surface** the resolved code in the
diagnostics output.

## 2. Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- A general, data-driven registry mapping each feature to an ordered candidate-code list.
- A pure, unit-testable resolver implementing **cap-string-first, probe-as-fallback**.
- Per-monitor persistence of the resolved map (including a "not supported" sentinel),
  reused across sessions and invalidated **only** by a user-initiated Refresh.
- `DdcCiController` reads/writes each feature through its resolved code.
- Resolved codes appear in the per-monitor diagnostics ("Copy Diagnostics").

### Non-Goals
- Changing native P/Invoke signatures (`GetVCPFeatureAndVCPFeatureReply`, `SetVCPFeature`).
- Reworking discrete features' value enumeration (input-source / power-state value
  lists still come from the capabilities string).
- A user-facing per-monitor code-override UI (out of scope; the registry is the source
  of candidate lists).
- Seeding alternate codes for features other than brightness. The mechanism is general;
  only brightness is seeded with multiple candidates now (decision: "general framework,
  brightness-only multi-candidate"). All other features keep a single-candidate list
  equal to their current constant.

## 3. Key Decisions (confirmed)

1. **Resolution model = cap-string-first, probe-as-fallback.**
   - Normal mode: resolve purely from the parsed capabilities string, in priority order.
   - Max-compatibility mode: same Phase 1; **only if** the cap string lists none of a
     feature's candidates do we actively probe candidates (read-only `GetVCP`) in
     priority order and take the first that responds with a usable value.
2. **Brightness candidate priority = `0x10` → `0x13` → `0x6B`.** Other features:
   single-candidate (their existing constant).
3. **Invalidation = user Refresh only.** A persisted map (code or sentinel) is reused
   indefinitely; the user-initiated Refresh clears it and forces re-resolution.
   Startup and the display-change watcher reuse persisted maps without clearing.
   - Documented consequence: a feature resolved to "not supported" via cap-string-only
     (max-compat off) will **not** be auto-re-probed when max-compat is later turned on;
     the user must press Refresh. This is the intended trade-off.
4. **Shape = general framework, brightness-only multi-candidate** (see Non-Goals).

## 4. Architecture

```
                 PowerDisplay (app)                         PowerDisplay.Lib
  MainViewModel ── reads/writes persisted maps ──► MonitorStateManager (state file)
       │  push persisted maps + maxCompat                       ▲  persist resolved maps
       ▼  (before discovery)                                    │
  MonitorManager ──────────────────────────────►  DdcCiController
                                                      │ BuildMonitorFromPhysical
                                                      │   caps + handle
                                                      ▼
                                                   VcpFeatureResolver.Resolve(
                                                      caps, maxCompat, persistedMap, probe)
                                                      │ uses VcpFeatureRegistry
                                                      ▼
                                                   Monitor.ResolvedVcpCodes (VcpFeatureCodeMap)
                                                      │
  CreateMonitorInfo ──► MonitorInfo.ResolvedVcpCodes ─┘ (settings.json → Settings UI)
                              │
                              ▼
                        MonitorInfo.GetDiagnosticsAsText()  (hex-only section)
```

Resolution runs **inside the discovery pipeline** so each feature's current value is
initialized through the correct code in a single pass. The persisted map and the
max-compat flag are pushed into the controller before discovery (mirroring the existing
`SetMaxCompatibilityMode`). The resolver itself is a pure function (no I/O, no
persistence) and is fully unit-testable with a fake `probe` delegate.

## 5. New types (`PowerDisplay.Lib`)

### 5.1 `VcpFeature` (enum)
`Brightness, Contrast, Volume, ColorTemperature, InputSource, PowerState`.
Each has a stable persistence/diagnostic key:
`brightness, contrast, volume, colorTemperature, inputSource, powerState`.

### 5.2 `VcpFeatureRegistry` (static)
Ordered candidate codes per feature (composed from `NativeConstants` literals, which
remain the single source of truth for the values):

| Feature          | Candidates (priority order)         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Brightness       | `0x10` → `0x13` → `0x6B`             |
| Contrast         | `0x12`                              |
| Volume           | `0x62`                              |
| ColorTemperature | `0x14`                              |
| InputSource      | `0x60`                              |
| PowerState       | `0xD6`                              |

API: `IReadOnlyList<byte> Candidates(VcpFeature)`, `byte Primary(VcpFeature)` (= first
candidate, used as a safe default), `IReadOnlyList<VcpFeature> AllFeatures`, plus
`string Key(VcpFeature)` / `bool TryParseKey(string, out VcpFeature)`.

### 5.3 `VcpFeatureCodeMap`
Per-monitor resolved result. Internally `Dictionary<VcpFeature, int>`:
- value `0x00`–`0xFF` → resolved code,
- value `NotSupportedSentinel` (`= -1`, named constant) → checked, no candidate works,
- key absent → that feature not resolved yet.

The `-1` sentinel is required (not laziness): the monitor-state file serializes with
`DefaultIgnoreCondition = WhenWritingNull`, which would silently drop a `null`-means-
unsupported encoding and erase the distinction between "checked-unsupported" and
"never-resolved". `-1` cannot collide with a real byte code.

API:
- `int GetCode(VcpFeature)` → resolved code if supported, else `VcpFeatureRegistry.Primary`
  (callers gate on `IsSupported`; primary is a safe fallback so a byte is always returned).
- `bool IsSupported(VcpFeature)` → has entry and entry != sentinel.
- `bool IsResolved(VcpFeature)` → has any entry (code or sentinel).
- `Dictionary<string,int> ToPersisted()` / `static VcpFeatureCodeMap FromPersisted(Dictionary<string,int>?)`
  (string keys via `VcpFeatureRegistry.Key`; unknown keys ignored for forward-compat).

### 5.4 `VcpFeatureResolver` (static, pure)
```csharp
static VcpFeatureCodeMap Resolve(
    VcpCapabilities caps,
    bool maxCompatibilityMode,
    VcpFeatureCodeMap? persisted,                 // per-feature reuse source
    Func<byte, bool> probe);                      // read-only GetVCP, returns true iff usable
```
Algorithm, per feature in `VcpFeatureRegistry.AllFeatures`:
1. **Per-feature reuse.** If `persisted` has an entry (code or sentinel) for this
   feature → copy it verbatim (no cap-string lookup, no probe). This makes reuse
   forward-compatible: a persisted map missing a newly-added feature resolves only the
   missing one.
2. Otherwise resolve fresh:
   1. **Phase 1 (both modes).** First candidate with `caps.SupportsVcpCode(candidate)` → code.
   2. **Phase 2 (max-compat only, fresh discovery, if Phase 1 found nothing).** Runs only when
      `persisted == null` — i.e. a first-time discovery or a post-refresh re-resolution (the user
      Refresh clears persisted maps to null). When a persisted map is supplied (a normal
      discovery that reuses prior results) probing is skipped entirely, since probing is the
      expensive path and the persisted decision already covers every feature. First candidate
      where `probe(candidate)` returns true → code.
   3. Else → `NotSupportedSentinel`.

   > In practice a persisted map always covers all features (resolution writes every feature), so
   > the per-feature reuse at the top and the `persisted == null` guard on Phase 2 together yield:
   > known monitor → reuse, no probe; new monitor or post-refresh → full resolve incl. probe.

`probe` is supplied by the controller and encodes **usability**, not mere call success:
`code => TryGetVcpFeature(handle, code, out cur, out max) && max > 0` — so brightness
never resolves to an advertised-but-dead code (aligns with the existing
`InitializeBrightness` range guard). Normal mode never invokes `probe`.

## 6. Controller changes (`DdcCiController`)

- Add `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, VcpFeatureCodeMap> PersistedVcpCodeMaps { get; set; }`
  (default empty), pushed before discovery like `MaxCompatibilityMode`.
- In `BuildMonitorFromPhysical`, **immediately after `monitor.VcpCapabilitiesInfo = caps;`
  and before `UpdateMonitorCapabilitiesFromVcp` / the `Initialize*` calls** (ordering is
  load-bearing — both downstream steps now read the resolved map):
  ```csharp
  PersistedVcpCodeMaps.TryGetValue(monitor.Id, out var persisted);
  monitor.ResolvedVcpCodes = VcpFeatureResolver.Resolve(
      caps, MaxCompatibilityMode, persisted,
      code => TryGetVcpFeature(physical.HPhysicalMonitor, code, monitor.Id, out var c, out var m) && m > 0);
  ```
- `UpdateMonitorCapabilitiesFromVcp`: **brightness support only** now derives from the
  resolved map — `if (monitor.ResolvedVcpCodes.IsSupported(VcpFeature.Brightness)) monitor.Capabilities |= Brightness;`.
  Contrast/volume/color-temperature support detection is **unchanged** (still cap-string
  based); those are single-candidate, so behavior is identical and risk is contained.
- `Initialize*` and `Get*/Set*` use `monitor.ResolvedVcpCodes.GetCode(feature)` instead
  of the `NativeConstants` literal. `InitializeBrightness` reads its max via the resolved
  brightness code; percent↔raw scaling (`BrightnessVcpMax`) is unchanged. For single-
  candidate features the resolved code equals the old constant, so reads/writes are
  byte-for-byte identical to today.

`Monitor` (model) gains `public VcpFeatureCodeMap ResolvedVcpCodes { get; set; } = new();`.

## 7. Persistence (`MonitorStateEntry` + `MonitorStateManager`)

- `MonitorStateEntry` gains
  `[JsonPropertyName("vcpFeatureCodes")] Dictionary<string,int>? VcpFeatureCodes`
  (null when never resolved; values include the `-1` sentinel). Register
  `Dictionary<string,int>` in `MonitorStateSerializationContext`.
- `MonitorStateManager` internal `MonitorState` mirrors the field; `LoadStateFromDisk`,
  `BuildStateJson`, `CloneState` carry it through. New API:
  - `VcpFeatureCodeMap? GetVcpCodeMap(string monitorId)`
  - `void UpdateVcpCodeMap(string monitorId, VcpFeatureCodeMap map)` — dirty-flag +
    debounced save; **skips write if the persisted dict is unchanged** (idempotent).
  - `void ClearAllVcpCodeMaps()` — nulls only `VcpFeatureCodes` on every entry (brightness/
    contrast/volume/color values are preserved), marks dirty, schedules save.

Example `monitor_state.json` entry:
```json
"\\\\?\\DISPLAY#DELD1A8#5&abc&0&UID1": {
  "brightness": 75,
  "vcpFeatureCodes": { "brightness": 107, "contrast": 18, "volume": -1,
                       "colorTemperature": 20, "inputSource": 96, "powerState": 214 },
  "lastUpdated": "2026-06-30T10:30:45.1"
}
```
(`107`=`0x6B`, `18`=`0x12`, `-1`=not supported, `20`=`0x14`, `96`=`0x60`, `214`=`0xD6`.)

## 8. App orchestration (`MainViewModel`)

- **Before discovery** (`InitializeAsync` and `RefreshMonitorsAsync`): build
  `Dictionary<string, VcpFeatureCodeMap>` from `_stateManager` for all known monitors and
  push via `_monitorManager.SetPersistedVcpCodeMaps(maps)` (new pass-through to the DDC
  controller), alongside the existing `SetMaxCompatibilityMode`.
- **After discovery** (in `UpdateMonitorList`, where `SaveMonitorsToSettings` already
  runs): for each discovered monitor call
  `_stateManager.UpdateVcpCodeMap(monitor.Id, monitor.ResolvedVcpCodes)` (idempotent).
- **Refresh clears**: `RefreshMonitorsAsync` calls `_stateManager.ClearAllVcpCodeMaps()`
  and pushes empty maps **before** re-discovery, forcing full re-resolution. Startup and
  the watcher path do **not** clear.
  - The "Refresh" the user means is the existing user-initiated refresh command that calls
    `RefreshMonitorsAsync` (confirm the exact command/button binding during implementation;
    the display-change-watcher entry must remain on the reuse path).

## 9. Diagnostics (`MonitorInfo` + `CreateMonitorInfo`)

- `MonitorInfo` (Settings.UI.Library) gains
  `[JsonPropertyName("resolvedVcpCodes")] Dictionary<string,int> ResolvedVcpCodes`
  and copies it in `UpdateFrom`. Register the dict type in the settings source-gen context.
- App `CreateMonitorInfo` populates it from `monitor.ResolvedVcpCodes.ToPersisted()`.
- `GetDiagnosticsAsText()` inserts a section between "Detected support" and
  "Raw capabilities":
  ```
  Resolved feature -> VCP code
  --------------------------------------------------
  Brightness: 0x6B
  Contrast: 0x12
  Volume: not supported
  ColorTemperature: 0x14
  InputSource: 0x60
  PowerState: 0xD6
  ```
  **Hex-only, no friendly names.** `GetDiagnosticsAsText` lives in
  `Settings.UI.Library`, which must not take a binary dependency on `PowerDisplay.Lib`
  (where `VcpNames` lives) — that pattern has crashed root apps before. Code names are
  still available to the reader: the existing `GetVcpCodesAsText()` block below already
  lists every detected code with its name. Sentinel renders `not supported`; an absent
  entry renders `not resolved`.

## 10. Tests (`PowerDisplay.Lib.UnitTests`, MSTest + Moq)

- `VcpFeatureResolverTests`:
  - Phase-1 priority: caps with `0x10` → brightness `0x10`; caps with only `0x6B` →
    brightness `0x6B`; caps with `0x13`+`0x6B` → `0x13` (priority).
  - Normal mode never probes: assert the `probe` delegate is invoked zero times.
  - Max-compat probe fallback: caps lists no brightness candidate, `probe(0x6B)` true →
    `0x6B`; assert probe call order honors priority and stops at first success.
  - Probe usability: `probe` returns false when `max == 0` → not chosen.
  - All-miss → sentinel.
  - Per-feature reuse: a persisted entry is copied verbatim and `probe`/caps are not
    consulted for that feature; a partially-populated persisted map resolves only the
    missing features.
- `VcpFeatureCodeMapTests`: `ToPersisted`/`FromPersisted` round-trip, sentinel semantics,
  unknown-key tolerance, `GetCode` fallback to `Primary`.
- `MonitorStateManager` round-trip test extended to assert `vcpFeatureCodes` survives
  save/load and `ClearAllVcpCodeMaps` preserves the value fields.

## 11. Edge cases & notes

- **Cap-string totally unreadable + max-compat**: existing `ProbeSupportedVcpFeatures`
  reconstructs a synthetic caps object from `{0x10,0x12,0x62}` only. Our resolver then
  runs on that synthetic caps; brightness alternates (`0x13`,`0x6B`) are found via our
  Phase-2 probe. This causes at most 1–2 redundant `GetVCP` reads on `0x10` in that rare
  path — accepted, not optimized.
- **Discrete features**: `GetCode` returns the standard code; value lists
  (`SupportedInputSources`, color presets) still come from `caps`. The resolved map only
  governs which code we read/write.
- **Forward/backward compat**: new JSON fields are additive. Old state/settings files
  lack them → treated as "never resolved" → resolved on next discovery. New files read by
  an older build → unknown fields ignored.
- **Concurrency**: discovery resolves per-monitor concurrently; the pushed persisted map
  and static registry are read-only during discovery; write-back is single-threaded in the
  app. No shared mutable state.
- **No new external dependencies**; no ABI/native-signature changes; settings/IPC schema
  only gains additive fields.

## 12. Out-of-scope follow-ups (not in this change)
- Friendly code names in the diagnostics "Resolved" section (would need a shared
  code-name table in `PowerDisplay.Models`, referenced by both Lib and Settings.UI.Library).
- Seeding multi-candidate lists for non-brightness features (extend `VcpFeatureRegistry`).
- A per-monitor manual code-override UI.
