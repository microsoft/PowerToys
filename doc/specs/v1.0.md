# PowerToys v1 strategy

<img align="right" width="200" src="./images/Logo.jpg" />

- **What is it:** Defining what work items need to happen for v1.0.  From here we can determine our workback schedule.
- **Authors:** Clint Rutkas
- **Spec Status:** Draft

# 1. Overview

## 1.1. Elevator Pitch / Narrative

A PowerToy is a utility that helps an end user to do a task faster. Batch renaming files, rotating / resizing an image quickly tweaking a monitor display setting, being able to mount an ISO, robustly copying a file from one place to another. These are all examples of items that are / have been a PowerToy.  Most PowerToys from 95 and XP were graduated into the Shell!

## 1.2. Customers

PowerToys exist for two reasons. Users want to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it to their individual workflows. We can be more targeted for scenarios to help do rapid iterations. Think about the countless small utilities that Microsoft engineers have written to make themselves more productive.

## 1.3. Existing Solutions or Expectations

There are a bunch of one-off applications in the Windows ecosystem. Each new PowerToy would look at the landscape and see how we can best address users’ needs and what would be the best experience.  There are also items in different states of support.  Since PowerToys is Open Source, community can help update and contribute back to them.

## 1.4. Goals/Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Quickly iterate and test new functionality that blocks Power users such as developers from adopting Windows
- Have functionality be designed in a way where the code could migrate back into Windows
- PowerToys only uses public APIs only.

**Non-goals:**

- Create a custom shell

# 2. Definition of Success

Expected Impact: Business, Customer, and Technology Outcomes, Experiments ...

| No. | Outcome | Measure |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 1 | Users population grows.| End user install |
| 2 | PowerToys is deemed bug free | Bugs opened against v1 PowerToys |
| 3 | PowerToys is stable | Crashes |
| 4 | Users enjoy PowerToys | Users continue to use PowerToys 2 & 10 days after |

# 3. Requirements

## 3.1. Goals for v1
