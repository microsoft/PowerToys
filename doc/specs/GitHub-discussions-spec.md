## What is GitHub Discussions

GitHub Discussions is a feature that currently is in closed beta status. It will be released until the end of the year. 

It's a new tab in the GitHub repo page where people can start new threads like in a forum.

The threads must be added to a category. The answer feature can be enabled or disabled for categorys. If enabled a person with triage permission or the creator of the thread can mark a reply as answer.

You can sort threads in the overview for categories and for (un-)answered.

One thread can be pinned on the main page of the discussion section. (One with rules or something like that).

Threads uses the same numeration like PR and issues. So they can be linked by the others. A conversation can also be locked like in issues and PR.

## Why do we need this for PowerToys

1. Sometimes people just want to say thank you to the PT team (like in https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/7873) and a thread in GitHub Discussions where every one can comment if he just want to say thank you, is much better for the users and the team than open every time a new issue for that.

2. Questions: If people just have questions, it gets difficult by asking them in issues. It's more useful for both sides (team and user) when questions are asked in a different section. Because in GitHub discussion you can mark a reply as the answer and other users can find the answer quicker.

3. Off-topic. Sometimes issue discussions get very and sometimes a little off-topic (like https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/7916#issuecomment-724813783) And it would be better if you can open a thread and write "As seen in #XXXX I think the real reason for ... is ..."
