# Telemetry
## Overview
[`Settings.UI.Library/Telemetry`](/src/settings-ui/Settings.UI.Library/Telemetry) contains telemetry events generated by `Settingsv2.` These event classes are derived from the [`EventBase`](/src/common/ManagedTelemetry/Telemetry/Events/EventBase.cs) class and [`IEvent`](/src/common/ManagedTelemetry/Telemetry/Events/IEvent.cs) class. [`IEvent`](/src/common/ManagedTelemetry/Telemetry/Events/IEvent.cs) class provides the lowest level abstraction, containing attributes such as privacy tags needed for every telemetry data. [`EventBase`](/src/common/ManagedTelemetry/Telemetry/Events/EventBase.cs) class provides a higher-level abstraction, having attributes common to all `PowerToys` telemetry events.

## Events
The following events are generated by `Settingsv2`:
1. [`SettingsBootEvent`](/src/settings-ui/Settings.UI.Library/Telemetry/Events/SettingsBootEvent.cs): This event captures the time taken by `Settingsv2` to initialize `MainWindow` UI control.
2. [`SettingsEnabledEvent.cs`](/src/settings-ui/Settings.UI.Library/Telemetry/Events/SettingsEnabledEvent.cs): This event is generated when a module is enabled or disabled.
