## Adding New Module Documentation

When adding documentation for a new module:

1. Create a dedicated markdown file for the module (e.g., `modulename.md`)
2. If the module has specialized debugging tools, consider creating a separate tools document (e.g., `modulename-tools.md`)
3. Update this index with links to the new documentation
4. Follow the existing documentation structure for consistency
