# Project Structure
## Overview
`PowerToys Run` is divided across several projects to keep a logical separation between plugins and core functionality. The following sections provide a brief overview of each project.

## Project Description
#### [`PowerLauncher`](/src/modules/launcher/PowerLauncher)
This is the startup project for the `PowerToys Run.` It is a WPF desktop application and follows the `Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)` design pattern. Plugins play the role of `Model` and provide data to `ViewModel.`

#### [`PowerLauncher.Telemetry`](/src/modules/launcher/PowerLauncher.Telemetry)
[`PowerLauncher.Telemetry`](/src/modules/launcher/PowerLauncher.Telemetry) is a .net core project that contains telemetry events generated by `PowerLauncher.` These events have been discussed in detail in [Launcher Telemetry](/doc/devdocs/modules/launcher/telemetry.md). 

#### [`Wox.Core`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Core)
[`Wox.Core`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Core) is a .net core project that contains helper classes required by the `PowerLauncher` project. Two major functionalities encapsulated in this project are [`PluginManager`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Core/Plugin/PluginManager.cs) and [`Query Builder.`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Core/Plugin/QueryBuilder.cs) [`PluginManager`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Core/Plugin/PluginManager.cs) provides an interface for managing C# plugins. [`Query Builder.`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Core/Plugin/QueryBuilder.cs) decimate user-typed query string and creates a [`Query`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Plugin/Query.cs) object. [`Query`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Plugin/Query.cs) object contains the action keyword and cleaned query, which is then sent to all plugins.

#### [`Wox.Infrastructure`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Infrastructure)
[`Wox.Infrastructure`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Infrastructure) is a .net core project that contains helper classes required for image manipulation and storage by the `PowerLauncher` project and the plugins. [`ImageLoader.cs`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Infrastructure/Image/ImageLoader.cs) class is used to load icons for `Win32` program. It also provides caching functionality to speed up image loading for frequently queried programs. 

#### [`Wox.Plugin`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Plugin) 
[`Wox.Plugin`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Plugin) contains interfaces that facilitate communication between `PowerLauncher` and plugins. These interfaces have been discussed in detail in [Flow of data between ViewModels and Plugins(Model)](/doc/devdocs/modules/launcher/architecture.md#flow-of-data-between-viewmodels-and-pluginsmodel). It also contains a helper class for logging. [`Log.cs`](/src/modules/launcher/Wox.Plugin/Logger/Log.cs) provides an abstraction for logging error, information, and output to text files. These files are stored at `%userprofile%/appdata/local/microsoft/powertoys/powertoys run/Logs.`
