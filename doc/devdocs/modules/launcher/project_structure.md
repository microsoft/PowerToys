# Project Structure
## Overview
`PT Run` is divided across several projects to keep a logical separation between plugins and core functionality. The following sections provide a brief overview of each project.

## Project Description
#### `PowerLauncher`
This is the startup project for the `PT Run.` It is a WPF desktop application and follows the `Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)` design pattern. Plugins play the role of `Model` and provide data to `ViewModel.`

#### `PowerLauncher.Telemetry`
`PowerLauncher.Telemetry` is a .net core project that contains telemetry events generated by `PowerToys Run.` These event classes are derived from the `EventBase` class and `IEvent` class. `IEvent` class provides the lowest level abstraction, containing attributes such as privacy tags needed for every telemetry data. `EventBase` class provides a higher-level abstraction, having attributes common to all `PowerToys Run` telemetry events.

#### `Wox.Core`
`Wox.Core` is a .net core project that contains helper classes required by the `PowerLauncher` project. Two major functionalities encapsulated in this project are `PluginManager` and `Query Builder.` `PluginManager` provides an interface for managing C# plugins. `Query Builder` decimate user-typed query string and creates a `Query` object. `Query` object contains the action keyword and cleaned query, which is then sent to all plugins.

#### `Wox.Infrastructure`
`Wox.Infrastructure` is a .net core project that contains helper classes required for logging, image manipulation, and storage by the `PowerLauncher` project and the plugins. `ImageLoader.cs` class is used to load icons for `Win32` program. It also provides caching functionality to speed up image loading for frequently queried programs. `Log.cs` provides an abstraction for logging error, information, and output to text files. These files are stored at `%userprofile%/appdata/local/microsoft/powertoys/powertoys run/Logs.`

#### `Wox.Plugin` 
`Wox.Plugin` contains interfaces that facilitate communication between `PowerLauncher` and plugins. These interfaces have been discussed in detail [here](/doc/devdocs/modules/launcher/architecture.md#flow-of-data-between-viewmodels-and-pluginsmodel).
