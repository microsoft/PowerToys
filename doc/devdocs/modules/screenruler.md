## Overview

Screen Ruler (project name: MeasureTool or Measure 2) is a PowerToys module that allows users to measure pixel distances and detect color boundaries on the screen. The tool renders an overlay UI using DirectX and provides several measurement utilities.

## Features

- **Bounce Utility**: Measure a rectangular zone by dragging with a left click
- **Spacing Tool**: Measure the length of a line with the same color with the same pixel value both horizontally and vertically
- **Horizontal Spacing**: Measure the line with the same color in the horizontal direction
- **Vertical Spacing**: Measure the line with the same color in the vertical direction

## Architecture & Implementation

The Screen Ruler module consists of several components:

### MeasureToolModuleInterface

- **Dllmain.cpp**: Provides functionality to start and stop the Measure Tool process based on hotkey events, manage settings, and handle events.

### MeasureToolUI

- **App.xaml.cs**: Main entrance of the app. Initializes MeasureToolCore and activates a new main window.
- **MainWindow.xaml.cs**: Sets properties and behaviors for the window, and handles user click interactions.
- **NativeMethods.cs**: Interacts with the Windows API to manipulate window properties, such as positioning and sizing.
- **Settings.cs**: Gets the default measure style from settings.

### PowerToys.MeasureToolCore

- **PowerToys.MeasureToolCore**: Handles initialization, state management, and starts the measure tool and bounds tool.
- **BGRATextureView.h**: Manages and interacts with BGRA textures in a Direct3D 11 context.
- **Measurement.cpp**: Defines a Measurement struct that represents a rectangular measurement area, including methods for converting and printing measurement details in various units.
- **Clipboard.cpp**: Copies measurement data to the clipboard.
- **D2DState.cpp**: Manages Direct2D rendering state and draws text boxes.
- **DxgiAPI.cpp**: Creates and manages Direct3D and Direct2D devices.
- **EdgeDetection.cpp**: Detects edges in a BGRA texture.
- **OverlayUI.cpp**: Creates and manages overlay windows for tools like MeasureTool and BoundsTool.
- **BoundsToolOverlayUI.cpp**: UI implementation for bounds feature. Handles mouse and touch events to draw measurement rectangles on the screen and display their pixels.
- **MeasureToolOverlayUI.cpp**: UI implementation for measure feature. Draws measurement lines on the screen and displays their pixels.
- **ScreenCapturing.cpp**: Continuously captures the screen, detects edges, and updates the measurement state for real-time drawing of measurement lines.
- **PerGlyphOpacityTextRender.cpp**: Renders text with varying opacity on a Direct2D render target.
