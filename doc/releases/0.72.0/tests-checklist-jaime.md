 * Drag and Drop:
   - [ ] Drag a file from Windows Explorer on one PC, cross the screen border onto another PC, and release it there. Verify that the file is copied to the other PC. Make sure the file size is below 100MB.
   - [ ] While dragging the file, verify that a corresponding icon is displayed under the mouse cursor.
