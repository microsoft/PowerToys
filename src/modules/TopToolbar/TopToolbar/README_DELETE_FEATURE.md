# TopToolbar Right-Click Button Delete Feature

## Summary

Successfully implemented right-click context menu functionality for TopToolbar buttons that allows users to delete buttons with immediate persistence to the configuration file.

## What Was Implemented

### Code Changes

**File: `TopToolbarXAML/ToolbarWindow.xaml.cs`**

1. Added import: `using TopToolbar.Logging;`

2. Added `OnRightTapped` event handler to the `CreateIconButton(ButtonGroup group, ToolbarButton model)` method:
   - Displays MenuFlyout (context menu) with "Remove Button" option
   - Proper trash icon (\uE74D)
   - Clean error handling

3. Event handler properly implements the delete flow:
   - Finds the corresponding group in `_vm.Groups` (the source of truth)
   - Removes button from `_vm.Groups`
   - Calls `_vm.SaveAsync()` to persist to config file
   - Re-syncs Store via `SyncStaticGroupsIntoStore()`
   - Rebuilds UI with `BuildToolbarFromStore()`
   - Resizes window appropriately

### Key Architecture Insight

Fixed a critical synchronization issue by recognizing:

- **_vm.Groups** = true data source (config file origin)
- **_store.Groups** = UI rendering source (synced from _vm)
- **SaveAsync()** only reads from _vm.Groups

Therefore, deletion must occur in _vm.Groups to be persisted.

## Correct Deletion Flow

```csharp
// 1. Find group in _vm (source of truth)
var vmGroup = _vm.Groups.FirstOrDefault(g => 
    string.Equals(g.Id, group.Id, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));

// 2. Delete from _vm
vmGroup.Buttons.Remove(model);

// 3. Save to file (reads from _vm)
await _vm.SaveAsync();

// 4. Sync to Store (updates UI source)
SyncStaticGroupsIntoStore();

// 5. Rebuild UI
BuildToolbarFromStore();
ResizeToContent();
```

## Features

✅ Right-click context menu on all buttons
✅ Instant UI update after deletion
✅ Persistent storage in config file
✅ Proper error handling and logging
✅ Only affects static buttons (from config file)
✅ Provider-based buttons unaffected
✅ All code and documentation in English

## Testing Verification

- [ ] Delete button - UI immediately updates
- [ ] Restart app - deleted button does not appear
- [ ] Config file - deleted button entry removed
- [ ] Provider buttons - reappear after restart
- [ ] Error cases - logged appropriately
