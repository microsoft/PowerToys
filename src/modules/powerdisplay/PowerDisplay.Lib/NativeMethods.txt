// Structs and constants only - functions use LibraryImport for AOT compatibility
// CsWin32 generates blittable types when allowMarshaling: false

// Note: All structs are manually defined in NativeStructures.cs with proper blittable layouts
// This file is intentionally left with only LUID as a minimal test
// Full DISPLAYCONFIG_* types need helper methods like GetViewGdiDeviceName() which CsWin32 doesn't provide

// Only request LUID from CsWin32 (other types manually defined in NativeStructures.cs)
LUID
