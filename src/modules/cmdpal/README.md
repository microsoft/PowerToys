# ![cmdpal logo](./Microsoft.CmdPal.UI/Assets/Stable/StoreLogo.scale-100.png) Command Palette

Windows Command Palette ("CmdPal") is the next iteration of PowerToys Run. With extensibility at it's core, the Command Palette is your one-stop launcher to start _anything_.

By default, CmdPal is bound to <kbd>Win+Alt+Space</kbd>. 


## Creating an extension

The fastest way to get started is just to run the "Create extension" command in the palette itself. That'll prompt you for a project name and a Display Name, and where you want to place your project. Then just open the `sln` it produces. You should be ready to go ðŸ™‚. 

The official API documentation can be found [on this docs site](TODO! Add docs link when we have one)

We've also got samples, so that you can see how the APIs in-action. 

* We've got [generic samples] in the repo
* We've got [real samples] in the repo too
* And we've even got [real extensions that we've "shipped" already]

> [!info]
> The Command Palette is currently in preview. Many features of the API are not yet fully implemented. We may introduce breaking API changes before CmdPal itself is v1.0.0

## Building CmdPal

The Command Palette is included as a part of PowerToys. To get started building, open up the root `PowerToys.sln`, to get started building. 

Projects of interest are:
* `Microsoft.CmdPal.UI`: This is the main project for CmdPal. Build and run this to get the CmdPal.
* `Microsoft.CommandPalette.Extensions`: This is the official extension interface. 
  * This is designed to be language-agnostic. Any programming language which supports implementing WinRT interfaces should be able to implement the WinRT interface. 
* `Microsoft.CommandPalette.Extensions.Toolkit`: This is a C# helper library for creating extensions. This makes writing extensions easier.
* Everything under "SampleExtensions": These are example plugins to demo how to author extensions. Deploy any number of these, to get a feel for how the extension API works. 

### Footnotes and other links

* [Initial SDK Spec]

[^1]: you'll almost definitely want to do a `git init` in that directory, and set up a git repo to track your work.
