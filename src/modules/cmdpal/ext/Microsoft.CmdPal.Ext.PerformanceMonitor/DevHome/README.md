The code in this directory was largely lifted from the [DevHome repo]. 

The specific directory we're using is 
https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/tree/main/extensions/CoreWidgetProvider
This has code for all the DevHome performance widgets.

Minimal changes have been made to match our style guidelines. 
Additionally, a much larger change was made to Resources.cs, to match our own
resource loading needs.

The code was lifted as of commit d52734ce0e33a82af3313d24c3c2979c37b68bab
