# Command Palette Extension Toolkit

The C# toolkit for building your own extension for the Command Palette.

The quickest way to get started building an extension is to install the Command
Palette, and use the "Create a new extension" command. That will set up a
project for you, with the packaging, dependencies, and basic program structure
ready to go.
