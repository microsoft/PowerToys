# Command Palette Extension Toolkit

The C# toolkit for building your own extension for the Command Palette.

The quickest way to get started building an extension is to install the Command
Palette, and use the "Create a new extension" command. That will set up a
project for you, with the packaging, dependencies, and basic program structure
ready to go.

To view the full docs, you can head over to [our docs site](TODO! docs link here when we have it)

You can also add extensions to your existing packages. For detailed docs on how,
refer to [this docs page](TODO! add docs link)

There are samples of just about everything you can do in [the samples project].
Head over there to see basic usage of the APIs.
