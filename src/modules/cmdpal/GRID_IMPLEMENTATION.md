# Grid List Pages Implementation

This document describes the implementation of Grid support for DevPal list pages.

## Overview

DevPal now supports displaying list pages in two modes:
- **List mode** (default): When `GridProperties` is null, items are displayed as a simple list with grouping by section
- **Grid mode**: When `GridProperties` is not null, items are displayed as a grid with each item being a `TileSize` square

## Implementation Details

### Core Changes

1. **ListViewModel.cs**:
   - Added `GridProperties` property that exposes `IGridProperties` from the model
   - Added `TileWidth` and `TileHeight` computed properties for safe access to tile dimensions
   - Updated `InitializeProperties()` and `FetchProperty()` to handle GridProperties changes

2. **ListPage.xaml**:
   - Added `GridItemViewModelTemplate` for grid item display with card-style layout
   - Modified UI structure with nested `SwitchPresenter` to choose between ListView and GridView
   - GridView configured with `ItemsWrapGrid` panel using TileSize from GridProperties

3. **ListPage.xaml.cs**:
   - Added complete event handlers for GridView (ItemClick, DoubleTapped, SelectionChanged, RightTapped, Loaded)
   - Created helper methods to abstract list/grid operations (IsGridMode, GetSelectedIndex, etc.)
   - Updated navigation commands and activation handlers to work with both ListView and GridView

### Sample Extension

Added `GridSamplePage` in SamplePagesExtension demonstrating:
- Grid functionality with 100x100 pixel tiles
- 20 sample items with icons, titles, and subtitles
- Integration into SamplePagesCommandsProvider

## Testing

To test the grid functionality:

1. **List mode test**:
   - Navigate to existing pages (which have GridProperties = null)
   - Verify they still display as lists with the same behavior

2. **Grid mode test**:
   - Navigate to "Sample Pages" â†’ "Grid Sample"
   - Verify items display in a grid layout with 100x100 tiles
   - Test navigation with arrow keys
   - Test selection and activation
   - Test search functionality

## Expected Behavior

### List Mode (GridProperties = null)
- Items displayed in vertical list format
- Existing behavior preserved
- Icon, title, subtitle, and tags shown horizontally

### Grid Mode (GridProperties != null)
- Items displayed in grid format with configurable tile size
- Each item is a card with icon centered at top, title below, subtitle at bottom
- Navigation works with arrow keys in grid pattern
- Selection, activation, and context menus work the same as list mode
- Search and filtering work the same as list mode

## Interface Usage

```csharp
// List mode (existing behavior)
public IGridProperties GridProperties => null;

// Grid mode with custom tile size
public IGridProperties GridProperties => new GridProperties() 
{ 
    TileSize = new Size(120, 120) 
};
```
