# Command Palette Core Values

1. It should be fun
2. Start **anything** here
3. It is for everyone
4. You shouldn't need a web browser just to use your PC
5. Success is measured in disengagement


## It should be fun

I really don't think that I need to explain this one. CmdPal should spark joy,
in all facets of it. The host app should be a seamless part of user's workflows.
It shouldn't ever be frustrating - it should be intuitive and seamlessly snappy.

The other side of this is the API should be fun to develop for. It should be
easy to get started, quick to iterate on, and simple to publish results.

## Start **anything** here 

Command Palette is a launcher for anything you want to do with your PC. Not just
for launching apps, or finding files, but quickly doing anything you want. To
build the best launcher application, we need it to be able to launch a diverse
set of experiences. From integrations with first-party apps and tools, to any
user's own meme generator extension - every app should be able to extend CmdPal
equally.

## By everyone, for everyone

This isn't just a tool for developers. Not just for power users. Command Palette
is for everyone. The best way to build an app inclusive of everyone, is with the
help of the entire community. The broadest set of contributors to both the host
app and extensions will enable these apps to work for everyone.

## You shouldn't need a web browser just to use your PC

Users shouldn't have to open a web browser for every little thing they want to
do. What users need should always be at their fingertips.

## Success is measured in disengagement mins 

Our goal is not to have you spending **more** time with the Command Palette.
It's to have you spending **less**. Get what you need done, then go live life.

Command Palette is here to get what you need, and get out. How fast we can help
the user get to what they need and get back to were doing - that's the metric
we're optimizing for here.
