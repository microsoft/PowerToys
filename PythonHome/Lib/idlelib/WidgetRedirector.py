    """Support for redirecting arbitrary widget subcommands.

    Some Tk operations don't normally pass through Tkinter.  For example, if a
    character is inserted into a Text widget by pressing a key, a default Tk
    binding to the widget's 'insert' operation is activated, and the Tk library
    processes the insert without calling back into Tkinter.

    Although a binding to <Key> could be made via Tkinter, what we really want
    to do is to hook the Tk 'insert' operation itself.

    When a widget is instantiated, a Tcl command is created whose name is the
    same as the pathname widget._w.  This command is used to invoke the various
    widget operations, e.g. insert (for a Text widget). We are going to hook
    this command and provide a facility ('register') to intercept the widget
    operation.

    In IDLE, the function being registered provides access to the top of a
    Percolator chain.  At the bottom of the chain is a call to the original
    Tk widget operation.
