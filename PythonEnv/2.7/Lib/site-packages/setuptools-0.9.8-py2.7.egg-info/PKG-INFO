        Installing and Using Setuptools
        ===============================
        
        .. contents:: **Table of Contents**
        
        
        -------------------------
        Installation Instructions
        -------------------------
        
        Upgrading from Distribute
        =========================
        
        Currently, Distribute disallows installing Setuptools 0.7+ over Distribute.
        You must first uninstall any active version of Distribute first (see
        `Uninstalling`_).
        
        Upgrading from Setuptools 0.6
        =============================
        
        Upgrading from prior versions of Setuptools is supported. Initial reports
        good success in this regard.
        
        Windows
        =======
        
        The recommended way to install setuptools on Windows is to download
        `ez_setup.py`_ and run it. The script will download the appropriate .egg
        file and install it for you.
        
        .. _ez_setup.py: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
        
        For best results, uninstall previous versions FIRST (see `Uninstalling`_).
        
        Once installation is complete, you will find an ``easy_install.exe`` program in
        your Python ``Scripts`` subdirectory.  For simple invocation and best results,
        add this directory to your ``PATH`` environment variable, if it is not already
        present.
        
        
        Unix-based Systems including Mac OS X
        =====================================
        
        Download `ez_setup.py`_ and run it using the target Python version. The script
        will download the appropriate version and install it for you::
        
            > wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py -O - | python
        
        Note that you will may need to invoke the command with superuser privileges to
        install to the system Python.
        
        Alternatively, on Python 2.6 and later, Setuptools may be installed to a
        user-local path::
        
            > wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
            > python ez_setup.py --user
        
        
        Advanced Installation
        =====================
        
        For more advanced installation options, such as installing to custom
        locations or prefixes, download and extract the source
        tarball from `Setuptools on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
        and run setup.py with any supported distutils and Setuptools options.
        For example::
        
            setuptools-x.x$ python setup.py --prefix=/opt/setuptools
        
        Use ``--help`` to get a full options list, but we recommend consulting
        the `EasyInstall manual`_ for detailed instructions, especially `the section
        on custom installation locations`_.
        
        .. _EasyInstall manual: https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/EasyInstall
        .. _the section on custom installation locations: https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations
        
        
        Downloads
        =========
        
        All setuptools downloads can be found at `the project's home page in the Python
        Package Index`_.  Scroll to the very bottom of the page to find the links.
        
        .. _the project's home page in the Python Package Index: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
        
        In addition to the PyPI downloads, the development version of ``setuptools``
        is available from the `Bitbucket repo`_, and in-development versions of the
        `0.6 branch`_ are available as well.
        
        .. _Bitbucket repo: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/get/default.tar.gz#egg=setuptools-dev
        .. _0.6 branch: http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/branches/setuptools-0.6/#egg=setuptools-dev06
        
        Uninstalling
        ============
        
        On Windows, if Setuptools was installed using an ``.exe`` or ``.msi``
        installer, simply use the uninstall feature of "Add/Remove Programs" in the
        Control Panel.
        
        Otherwise, to uninstall Setuptools or Distribute, regardless of the Python
        version, delete all ``setuptools*`` and ``distribute*`` files and
        directories from your system's ``site-packages`` directory
        (and any other ``sys.path`` directories) FIRST.
        
        If you are upgrading or otherwise plan to re-install Setuptools or Distribute,
        nothing further needs to be done. If you want to completely remove Setuptools,
        you may also want to remove the 'easy_install' and 'easy_install-x.x' scripts
        and associated executables installed to the Python scripts directory.
        
        --------------------------------
        Using Setuptools and EasyInstall
        --------------------------------
        
        Here are some of the available manuals, tutorials, and other resources for
        learning about Setuptools, Python Eggs, and EasyInstall:
        
        * `The EasyInstall user's guide and reference manual`_
        * `The setuptools Developer's Guide`_
        * `The pkg_resources API reference`_
        * `Package Compatibility Notes`_ (user-maintained)
        * `The Internal Structure of Python Eggs`_
        
        Questions, comments, and bug reports should be directed to the `distutils-sig
        mailing list`_.  If you have written (or know of) any tutorials, documentation,
        plug-ins, or other resources for setuptools users, please let us know about
        them there, so this reference list can be updated.  If you have working,
        *tested* patches to correct problems or add features, you may submit them to
        the `setuptools bug tracker`_.

        * The original design for the ``.egg`` format and the ``pkg_resources`` API was
          co-created by Phillip Eby and Bob Ippolito.  Bob also implemented the first
          version of ``pkg_resources``, and supplied the OS X operating system version
          compatibility algorithm.
        
        * Ian Bicking implemented many early "creature comfort" features of
          easy_install, including support for downloading via Sourceforge and
          Subversion repositories.  Ian's comments on the Web-SIG about WSGI
          application deployment also inspired the concept of "entry points" in eggs,
          and he has given talks at PyCon and elsewhere to inform and educate the
          community about eggs and setuptools.
        
        * Jim Fulton contributed time and effort to build automated tests of various
          aspects of ``easy_install``, and supplied the doctests for the command-line
          ``.exe`` wrappers on Windows.
        
        * Phillip J. Eby is the seminal author of setuptools, and
          first proposed the idea of an importable binary distribution format for
          Python application plug-ins.
        
        * Significant parts of the implementation of setuptools were funded by the Open
          Source Applications Foundation, to provide a plug-in infrastructure for the
          Chandler PIM application.  In addition, many OSAF staffers (such as Mike
          "Code Bear" Taylor) contributed their time and stress as guinea pigs for the
          use of eggs and setuptools, even before eggs were "cool".  (Thanks, guys!)
        
        * Since the merge with Distribute, Jason R. Coombs is the
          maintainer of setuptools.  The project is maintained in coordination with
          the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) and the larger Python community.

        0.7
        ---
        
        * Merged Setuptools and Distribute. See docs/merge.txt for details.
        
        Added several features that were slated for setuptools 0.6c12:
        
        * Index URL now defaults to HTTPS.
        * Added experimental environment marker support. Now clients may designate a
          PEP-426 environment marker for "extra" dependencies. Setuptools uses this
          feature in ``setup.py`` for optional SSL and certificate validation support
          on older platforms. Based on Distutils-SIG discussions, the syntax is
          somewhat tentative. There should probably be a PEP with a firmer spec before
          the feature should be considered suitable for use.
        * Added support for SSL certificate validation when installing packages from
          an HTTPS service.
        
        -----
        0.7b4
        -----
        
        * `Issue #3 <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/3>`_: Fixed NameError in SSL support.
        
        ------
        0.6.49
        ------
        
        * Move warning check in ``get_cache_path`` to follow the directory creation
          to avoid errors when the cache path does not yet exist. Fixes the error
          reported in `Distribute #375 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/375>`_.
        
        ------
        0.6.48
        ------
        
        * Correct AttributeError in ``ResourceManager.get_cache_path`` introduced in

        ------
        0.6.45
        ------
        
        * `Distribute #379 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/379>`_: ``distribute_setup.py`` now traps VersionConflict as well,
          restoring ability to upgrade from an older setuptools version.
        
        ------
        0.6.44
        ------
        
        * ``distribute_setup.py`` has been updated to allow Setuptools 0.7 to
          satisfy use_setuptools.
        
        ------
        0.6.43
        ------
        
        * `Distribute #378 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/378>`_: Restore support for Python 2.4 Syntax (regression in 0.6.42).

        * `Distribute #337 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/337>`_: Moved site.py to setuptools/site-patch.py (graft of very old
          patch from setuptools trunk which inspired PR `#31 <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/31>`_).
        
        ------
        0.6.41
        ------
        
        * `Distribute #27 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/27>`_: Use public api for loading resources from zip files rather than
          the private method `_zip_directory_cache`.
        * Added a new function ``easy_install.get_win_launcher`` which may be used by
          third-party libraries such as buildout to get a suitable script launcher.
        
        ------
        0.6.40
        ------
        
        * `Distribute #376 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/376>`_: brought back cli.exe and gui.exe that were deleted in the
          previous release.
        
        ------
        0.6.39

        * Launcher build script now refactored for robustness.
        * `Distribute #375 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/375>`_: Resources extracted from a zip egg to the file system now also
          check the contents of the file against the zip contents during each
          invocation of get_resource_filename.
        
        ------
        0.6.38
        ------
        
        * `Distribute #371 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/371>`_: The launcher manifest file is now installed properly.
        
        ------
        0.6.37
        ------
        
        * `Distribute #143 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/143>`_: Launcher scripts, including easy_install itself, are now
          accompanied by a manifest on 32-bit Windows environments to avoid the
          Installer Detection Technology and thus undesirable UAC elevation described
          in `this Microsoft article
          <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709628%28WS.10%29.aspx>`_.
        
        ------
        0.6.36
        ------
        
        * Pull Request `#35 <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/35>`_: In `Buildout #64 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/64>`_, it was reported that
          under Python 3, installation of distutils scripts could attempt to copy
          the ``__pycache__`` directory as a file, causing an error, apparently only
          under Windows. Easy_install now skips all directories when processing
          metadata scripts.
        
        ------
        0.6.35
        ------
        
        
        Note this release is backward-incompatible with distribute 0.6.23-0.6.34 in

        * `Distribute #21 <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/21>`_: Allow PackageIndex.open_url to gracefully handle all cases of a
          httplib.HTTPException instead of just InvalidURL and BadStatusLine.

          to point to the actively maintained virtualenv instead.

        * When run from within buildout, no attempt is made to modify an existing
          setuptools egg, whether in a shared egg directory or a system setuptools.
