// Code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program 
// is tested by a particular test suite. A program with high code coverage, measured as a percentage, 
// has had more of its source code executed during testing which suggests it has a lower chance of 
// containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low code coverage.
//
// Code coverage is certainly the most important quality code metric. But coverage is not enough
// the team needs to ensure that results are checked at test-time. These checks can be done both 
// in test code, and in application code through assertions. The important part is that a test
// must fail explicitely when a check gets unvalidated during the test execution.
//
// This quality gate define a warn threshold (70%) and a fail threshold (80%). These are 
// indicative thresholds and in practice the more the better. To achieve high coverage and 
// low risk, make sure that new and refactored classes gets 100% covered by tests and that
// the application and test code contains as many checks/assertions as possible.

// Maybe you are facing the **God Class** phenomenon:
// A **God Class** is a class that controls way too many other classes 
// in the system and has grown beyond all logic to become 
// *The Class That Does Everything*.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Types with many lines of code
// should be split in a group of smaller types.
// 
// To refactor a *God Class* you'll need patience, 
// and you might even need to recreate everything from scratch.
// Here are a few refactoring advices:
//
// • The logic in the *God Class* must be splitted in smaller classes.
// These smaller classes can eventually become private classes nested
// in the original *God Class*, whose instances objects become 
// composed of instances of smaller nested classes.
//
// • Smaller classes partitioning should be driven by the multiple
// responsibilities handled by the *God Class*. To identify these 
// responsibilities it often helps to look for subsets of methods
// strongly coupled with subsets of fields.
//
// • If the *God Class* contains way more logic than states, a good 
// option can be to define one or several static classes that 
// contains no static field but only pure static methods. A pure static 
// method is a function that computes a result only from inputs
// parameters, it doesn't read nor assign any static or instance field.
// The main advantage of pure static methods is that they are easily
// testable.
// 
// • Try to maintain the interface of the *God Class* at first 
// and delegate calls to the new extracted classes. 
// In the end the *God Class* should be a pure facade without its own logic.
// Then you can keep it for convenience or throw it away and 
// start to use the new classes only.
//
// • Unit Tests can help: write tests for each method before extracting it 
// to ensure you don't break functionality.
//
// The estimated Debt, which means the effort to fix such issue,
// varies linearly from 1 hour for a 200 lines of code type,
// up to 10 hours for a type with 2.000 or more lines of code.
//
// In Debt and Interest computation, this rule takes account of the fact 
// that static types with no mutable fields are just a collection of 
// static methods that can be easily splitted and moved from one type 
// to another.

// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle
//
// Hence a base class should be designed properly to make it easy to derive from,

//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Understand the need for using derivatives,

//<HowToFix>
// In *Object-Oriented Programming*, a well-known motto is

// This is because *inheritance* comes with pitfalls.

// On the other hands, *Composition* favors binding with interfaces

// This rule matches constructors of a non-sealed class that call one or

//<Description>
// This rule warns about nested types not declared as private.
//
// A nested type is a type declared within the scope of another 
// type. Nested types are useful for encapsulating private 
// implementation details of the containing type. Used 
// for this purpose, nested types should not be externally visible.
//
// Do not use externally visible nested types for logical 
// grouping or to avoid name collisions; instead use namespaces.
//
// Nested types include the notion of member accessibility, 
// which some programmers do not understand clearly.
//
// Protected types can be used in subclasses and nested types 
// in advanced customization scenarios.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// If you do not intend the nested type to be externally visible,
// change the type's accessibility. 
//
// Otherwise, remove the nested type from its parent and make it 
// *non-nested*.
//
// If the purpose of the nesting is to group some nested types, 
// use a namespace to create the hierarchy instead.
//
// The estimated Debt, which means the effort to fix such issue,
// is 2 minutes per nested type plus 4 minutes per outter type
// using such nesting type.

// This rule computes the *Relational Cohesion* metric for

// 
// The *Relational Cohesion* for an project, is the total number 
// of relationship between types of the projects, divided 
// by the number of types. In other words it is the average
// number of types in the project used by a type in the project.
//
// As classes inside an project should be strongly related, 
// the cohesion should be high. On the other hand, a value 
// which is too high may indicate over-coupling. A good range

//<Description>
// The **Abstractness versus Instability Diagram** that is shown in the CppDepend 
// report helps to assess which projects are **potentially painful to maintain**
// (i.e concrete and stable) and which projects are **potentially useless** 
// (i.e abstract and instable).
//
// • **Abstractness**: If an project contains many abstract types 
// (i.e interfaces and abstract classes) and few concrete types, 
// it is considered as abstract.
//
// • **Stability**: An project is considered stable if its types 
// are used by a lot of types from other projects. In this context 
// stable means *painful to modify*.
//
// From these metrics, we define the *perpendicular normalized distance of
// an project from the idealized line* **A + I = 1** (called *main sequence*). 
// This metric is an indicator of the project's balance between abstractness 
// and stability. We precise that the word *normalized* means that the range 
// of values is [0.0 … 1.0].
//
// This rule warns about projects with a *normalized distance* greater than 
// than 0.7.
//
// This rules use the default code metric on project
// *Normalized Distance from the Main Sequence* explained here: 
// http://www.cppdepend.com/Metrics#DitFromMainSeq
//
// These concepts have been originally introduced by *Robert C. Martin*
// in 1994 in this paper: http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/oodmetrc.pdf
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Violations of this rule indicate projects with an improper 
// *abstractness / stability* balance.
//
// • Either the project is *potentially painful to maintain* (i.e is massively
// used and contains mostly concrete types). This can be fixed by creating 
// abstractions to avoid too high coupling with concrete implementations.
//
// • Either the project is *potentially useless* (i.e contains mostly
// abstractions and is not used enough). In such situation, the design
// must be reviewed to see if it can be enhanced.
//
// The severity of issues of this rule is **Low** because
// the *Abstractness/Instability principle* is an information 
// about the code structure state but **is not actionable**, 
// it doesn't tell precisely what to do obtain a better score.
//
// Fixing actionable issues of others **Architecture** and 
// **Code Quality** default rules will necessarily push 
// the *Abstractness/Instability principle* scores in the 
// right direction.

//<Description>
// This rule lists methods not covered at all by test
// or partially covered by tests.
//
// For each match, the rules estimates the **technical debt**, i.e
// the effort to write unit and integration tests for the method.
// The estimation is based on the effort to develop the code element
// multiplied by factors in the range ]0,1.3] based on 
//
// • the method code size and complexity
//
// • the actual percentage coverage
//
// • the abstracness of types used, because relying on classes instead of 
// interfaces makes the code more difficult to test
//
// • the method visibility because testing private or protected
// methods is more difficult than testing public and internal ones
//
// • the fields used by the method, because is is more complicated to 
// write tests for methods that read mutable static fields whose changing 
// state is shared across tests executions.
//
// • whether the method is considered *JustMyCode* or not because *NotMyCode*
// is often generated easier to get tested since tests can be generated as well.
//
// This rule is necessarily a large source of technical debt, since
// the code left untested is by definition part of the technical debt.
//
// This rule also estimates the **annual interest**, i.e the annual cost 
// to let the code uncovered, based on the effort to develop the 
// code element, multiplied by factors based on usage of the code element.

//<Description>
// This rule is executed only if some code coverage data is imported
// from some code coverage files.
//
// So far this rule is disabled because other code coverage rules 
// assess properly code coverage issues.
//
// **Change Risk Analyzer and Predictor** (i.e. CRAP) is a code metric
// that helps in pinpointing overly both complex and untested code.
// Is has been first defined here: 
// http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=215899
//
// The Formula is:  **CRAP(m) = CC(m)^2 * (1 – cov(m)/100)^3 + CC(m)**
//
// • where *CC(m)* is the *cyclomatic complexity* of the method *m*
//
// • and *cov(m)* is the *percentage coverage* by tests of the method *m*
//
// Matched methods cumulates two highly *error prone* code smells:
//
// • A complex method, difficult to develop and maintain.
//
// • Non 100% covered code, difficult to refactor without introducing any regression bug.
//
// The higher the CRAP score, the more painful to maintain and error prone is the method.
//
// An arbitrary threshold of 30 is fixed for this code rule as suggested by inventors.
//
// Notice that no amount of testing will keep methods with a Cyclomatic Complexity
// higher than 30, out of CRAP territory.
//
// Notice that this rule doesn't match too short method
// with less than 10 lines of code.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// In such situation, it is recommended to both refactor the complex method logic
// into several smaller and less complex methods 
// (that might belong to some new types especially created),
// and also write unit-tests to full cover the refactored logic. 
//
// You'll find code impossible to cover by unit-tests, like calls to *MessageBox.Show()*.
// An infrastructure must be defined to be able to *mock* such code at test-time.
