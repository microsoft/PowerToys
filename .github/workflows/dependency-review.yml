# Dependency Review Action
#
# This Action will scan dependency manifest files that change as part of a Pull Request,
# surfacing known-vulnerable versions of the packages declared or updated in the PR.
# Once installed, if the workflow run is marked as required,
# PRs introducing known-vulnerable packages will be blocked from merging.
#
# As recommended by Microsoft's security guidelines (https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/security/tsg/actions/#requirements-for-security-hardening-your-own-github-actions), 
# 3rd-party actions should be pinned to a specific commit hash to prevent supply chain attacks. 
# This update aligns with best practices; 1st/2nd-party actions is not required hash pinning.
