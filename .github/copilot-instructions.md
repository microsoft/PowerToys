## I'm doing a powertoys command palette extension development, the command palette host app doc sits here:
src\modules\cmdpal\doc\initial-sdk-spec\initial-sdk-spec.md

And the extension sdk doc sits here:
src\modules\cmdpal\extensionsdk

You should refer to the extensionsdk, and figure out the way to build a command palette extension instead of self inventing terminology.

I'm doing a powertoys internal dev, and already configured the dependency
