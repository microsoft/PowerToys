.SYNOPSIS
Ensures a code signing certificate exists and is trusted in all necessary certificate stores.

.DESCRIPTION
This script provides two functions:

1. EnsureCertificate:
   - Searches for an existing code signing certificate by subject name.
   - If not found, creates a new self-signed certificate.
   - Exports the certificate and attempts to import it into:
     - CurrentUser\TrustedPeople
     - CurrentUser\Root
     - LocalMachine\Root (admin privileges may be required)

2. ImportAndVerifyCertificate:
   - Imports a `.cer` file into the specified certificate store if not already present.
   - Verifies the certificate is successfully imported by checking thumbprint.

This is useful in build or signing pipelines to ensure a valid and trusted certificate is available before signing MSIX or executable files.

.PARAMETER certSubject
The subject name of the certificate to search for or create. Default is:
"CN=Microsoft Corporation, O=Microsoft Corporation, L=Redmond, S=Washington, C=US"

.PARAMETER cerPath
(ImportAndVerifyCertificate only) The file path to a `.cer` certificate file to import.

.PARAMETER storePath
(ImportAndVerifyCertificate only) The destination certificate store path (e.g. Cert:\CurrentUser\Root).

.EXAMPLE
$cert = EnsureCertificate

Ensures the default certificate exists and is trusted, and returns the certificate object.

.EXAMPLE
ImportAndVerifyCertificate -cerPath "$env:TEMP\temp_cert.cer" -storePath "Cert:\CurrentUser\Root"

Imports a certificate into the CurrentUser Root store and verifies its presence.

.NOTES
- For full trust, administrative privileges may be needed to import into LocalMachine\Root.
- Certificates are created using RSA and SHA256 and marked as CodeSigningCert.
