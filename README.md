# What's Happening

The first two utilities we're working on are:

1. Maximize to new desktop widget - The MTND widget shows a pop-up button when a user hovers over the maximize / restore button on any window.  Clicking it creates a new desktop, sends the app to that desktop and maximizes the app on the new desktop.

2. Windows key shortcut guide - The shortcut guide appears when a user holds the Windows key down for more than one second and shows the available shortcuts for the current state of the desktop.
