## Installing and running Microsoft PowerToys

### Requirements

- Windows 11 or Windows 10 version 2004 (code name 20H1 / build number 19041) or newer.
- x64 or ARM64 processor
- Our installer will install the following items:
   - [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) bootstrapper. This will install the latest version.

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

Go to the [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link] and click on `Assets` at the bottom to show the files available in the release. Please use the appropriate PowerToys installer that matches your machine's architecture and install scope. For most, it is `x64` and per-user.

## What's Happening

### PowerToys Roadmap

Our [prioritized roadmap][roadmap] of features and utilities that the core team is focusing on.

### 0.92 - June 2025 Update

In this release, we focused on new features, stability, optimization improvements, and automation.

**✨Highlights**

 - Bug Report Tool now has a faster and clearer reporting process, with progress indicators, improved compression, auto-cleanup of old trace logs, and inclusion of MSIX installer logs for more efficient diagnostics.
 - File Explorer add-ons now have improved rendering stability, resolving issues with PDF previews, blank thumbnails, and text file crashes during file browsing.

### Color Picker

 - Added mouse button actions so you can choose what left, right, or middle click does. Thanks [@PesBandi](https://github.com/PesBandi)!

### Command Palette extensions

 - Added "Copy Path" command to *App* search results for convenience. Thanks [@PesBandi](https://github.com/PesBandi)!
 - Improved *Calculator* input experience by ignoring leading equal signs. Thanks [@PesBandi](https://github.com/PesBandi)!

### Command Palette Ahead-of-Time (AOT) readiness

 - We’ve made foundational changes to prepare the Command Palette for future Ahead-of-Time (AOT) publishing. This includes replacing the calculator library with ExprTk, improving COM object handling, refining Win32 interop, and correcting trimming behavior—all to ensure compatibility, performance, and reliability under AOT constraints. All first-party extensions are now AOT-compatible. These improvements lay the groundwork for publishing Command Palette as an AOT application in the next release.
 - Special thanks to [@Sergio0694](https://github.com/Sergio0694) for guidance on making COM APIs AOT-compatible, [@jtschuster](https://github.com/jtschuster) for fixing COM object handling, [@ArashPartow](https://github.com/ArashPartow) from ExprTk for integration suggestions, and [@tian-lt](https://github.com/tian-lt) from the Windows Calculator team for valuable suggestion throughout the migration journey and review.
 - As part of the upcoming release, we’re also enabling AOT compatibility for key dependencies, including markdown rendering, Adaptive Cards, internal logging and telemetry library, and the core Command Palette UX.

### FancyZones

 - Fixed DPI-scaling issues to ensure FancyZones Editor displays crisply on high-resolution monitors. Thanks [@HO-COOH](https://github.com/HO-COOH)! This inspired us a broader review across other PowerToys modules, leading to DPI display optimizations in Awake, Color Picker, PowerAccent, and more.

### File Explorer add-ons

 - Fixed potential failures in PDF previewer and thumbnail generation, improving reliability when browsing PDF files. Thanks [@mohiuddin-khan-shiam](https://github.com/mohiuddin-khan-shiam)!  
 - Prevented Monaco Preview Handler crash when opening UTF-8-BOM text files.  

### Hosts File Editor

 - Added an in-app *“Learn more”* link to warning dialogs for quick guidance. Thanks [@PesBandi](https://github.com/PesBandi)!  

### Mouse Without Borders

 - Fixed firewall rule so MWB now accepts connections from IPs outside your local subnet.
 - Cleaned legacy logs to reduce disk usage and noise.  

### Peek

 - Updated QOI reader so 3-channel QOI images preview correctly in Peek and File Explorer. Thanks [@mbartlett21](https://github.com/mbartlett21)!  
 - Added codec detection with a clear warning when a video can’t be previewed, along with a link to the Microsoft Store to download the required codec.

### PowerRename

 - Added support for $YY-$MM-$DD in ModificationTime and AccessTime to enable flexible date-based renaming.

### PowerToys Run

 - Suppressed error UI for known WPF-related crashes to reduce user confusion, while retaining diagnostic logging for analysis. This targets COMException 0xD0000701 and 0x80263001 caused by temporary DWM unavailability.

### Registry Preview

 - Added "Extended data preview" via magnifier icon and context menu in the Data Grid, enabled easier inspection of complex registry types like REG_BINARY, REG_EXPAND_SZ, and REG_MULTI_SZ, etc. Thanks [@htcfreek](https://github.com/htcfreek)! 
 - Improved file-saving experience in Registry Preview by aligning with Notepad-like behavior, enhancing user prompts, error handling, and preventing crashes during unsaved or interrupted actions. Thanks [@htcfreek](https://github.com/htcfreek)!  

### Settings

 - Added an option to hide or show the PowerToys system tray icon. Thanks [@BLM16](https://github.com/BLM16)!
 - Improved settings to show progress while a bug report package is being generated.

### Workspaces

 - Stored Workspaces icons in user AppData to ensure profile portability and prevent loss during temporary folder cleanup.
 - Enabled capture and launch of PWAs on non-default Edge or Chrome profiles, ensuring consistent behavior during creation and execution.

### Documentation

 - Added SpeedTest and Dictionary Definition to the third-party plugins documentation for PowerToys Run. Thanks [@ruslanlap](https://github.com/ruslanlap)!
 - Corrected sample links and typo in Command Palette documentation. Thanks [@daverayment](https://github.com/daverayment) and [@roycewilliams](https://github.com/roycewilliams)!

### Development
