## ✨ What's new
**Version 0.96 (November 2025)**

For an in-depth look at the latest changes, visit the [Windows Command Line blog](https://aka.ms/powertoys-releaseblog).

**✨ Highlights**
 - Advanced Paste now supports multiple online and on-device AI model providers: Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Mistral, Foundry Local and Ollama.
 - Command Palette received extensive improvements including file search filters, better clipboard history metadata, context-menu styling, and dozens of bug fixes and enhancements.
 - PowerRename can now extract and use photo metadata (EXIF, XMP) in renaming patterns like `%Camera`, `%Lens`, and `%ExposureTime`.

### Advanced Paste
 - Advanced Paste now lets you connect to multiple AI providers instead of being limited to a single OpenAI provider. See [Advanced Paste documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/powertoys/advanced-paste) for usage.

### Awake
 - The Awake countdown timer now stays accurate over long periods. Thanks [@daverayment](https://github.com/daverayment)!
 - Fixed Awake context menu positioning. The fix removed the conversion of the mouse cursor from screen to client-window coordinates, instead using the raw screen coordinates returned by GetCursorPos; the context menu now appears at the correct screen position. Thanks [@lzandman](https://github.com/lzandman)!

### Command Palette
 - The search field in context menus now matches the look of the Command Palette, with a smoke backdrop and improved padding.
 - Fallback items such as math calculations or the Run command now appear in results more quickly. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Ensured the command bar updates correctly after navigating to another page and commands are displayed correctly. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - The Command Palette settings page has been reorganized. Activation-key options are grouped under an expander and extension settings are framed for improved readability.
 - When you modify a command, its alias, hotkey, and tags now update in the top-level list, keeping the displayed information in sync. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Press `Ctrl + ,` to open Command Palette settings from anywhere. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - You can use `Page Up` and `Page Down` to navigate the list while focus is in the search box. Thanks [@samrueby](https://github.com/samrueby)!
 - Fixed an issue where the search box could disappear when navigating pages. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Ensured search text is selected when *Go home when activated* and *Highlight search on activate* are both enabled. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Fixed an issue where Command Palette window occasionally appeared on the taskbar under certain Windows settings. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Ensured that labels and icons of list items and menu items update when they change. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Fixed visibility of list filters when navigating to a content page. Thanks [@DevLGuilherme](https://github.com/DevLGuilherme)!
 - Added search to the extension list and a link to extensions on the Microsoft Store. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Added options to open the Command Palette window at its last position or re-center it.
 - The Command Palette now remembers its window size after restarting.
 - Added a global error handler that logs fatal errors and provides feedback when unexpected failures force Command Palette to close. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Fixed forms and extension settings not showing on some machines due to a missing VC++ runtime.
 - Restored ranking of fallback commands for built-in extensions (Sleep, Shutdown, Windows settings, Web search, etc.). Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).
 - Improved and unified labels and texts across the application!
 - Maintainance: Resolved numerous build warnings in Command Palette projects; no user-visible impact. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Maintainance: Fixed a logging issue so exception messages are properly recorded instead of placeholder text, improving troubleshooting. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!

### Command Palette Extensions
 - Bookmarks: Added hints about bookmark placeholders to the Add/Edit Bookmark form. — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Bookmarks: Improved migration of bookmarks from older versions and fixed an issue where aliases or keyboard shortcuts could be lost after restart. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Clipboard history: Items shown in Command Palette’s clipboard history now include helpful metadata. For example, image items show dimensions, text files show names and sizes, web links include page titles, and text entries display word counts. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - File search: Added filter buttons to show *all items*, *files only*, or *folders only*. Selecting a filter adds `kind:folders` or `kind:not folders` to narrow results.
 - System commands: Replaced the `:red_circle:` placeholder with an actual red-circle emoji so the correct icon appears in the UI. Thanks [@samrueby](https://github.com/samrueby)!
 - WinGet: Search performance feels more responsive because typed input is now processed via a task queue rather than complex cancellation tokens!
 - Window Walker: UWP apps no longer show a "not responding" label when suspended. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
