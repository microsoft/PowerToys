```

#### Machine-wide scope installer

```powershell
winget install --scope machine Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop. If these are your preferred install solutions, you can find the install instructions there.

## Third-Party Run Plugins

There is a collection of [third-party plugins](./doc/thirdPartyRunPlugins.md) created by the community that aren't distributed with PowerToys.

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions of all types.  Besides  coding features / bug fixes,  other ways to assist include spec writing, design, documentation, and finding bugs. We are excited to work with the power user community to build a set of tools for helping you get the most out of Windows.

We ask that **before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute**, please read our [Contributor's Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). We would be happy to work with you to figure out the best approach, provide guidance and mentorship throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.

Most contributions require you to agree to a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][oss-CLA] declaring that you grant us the rights to use your contribution and that you have permission to do so.
