## ✨ What's new
**Version 0.96 (November 2025)**

For an in-depth look at the latest changes, visit the [Windows Command Line blog](https://aka.ms/powertoys-releaseblog).

**✨ Highlights**
 - Advanced Paste now supports multiple AI providers instead of being limited to a single OpenAI provider, with a new settings page for easy configuration.
 - **NEW:** The **Cursor Wrap** utility lets your mouse pointer move seamlessly from one edge of the screen to the opposite edge, supporting up to nine monitors.
 - Command Palette received extensive improvements including file search filters, better clipboard history metadata, context-menu styling, and dozens of bug fixes and enhancements.
 - Light Switch improvements include an Off mode, better override detection, immediate schedule updates, and the "New" badge has been removed now that the feature is established.
 - PowerRename can now extract and use photo metadata (EXIF, XMP) in renaming patterns like `%Camera`, `%Lens`, and `%ExposureTime`.
 - Peek can now be activated from the command line or through a named pipe for integration with scripts and other tools.
 - Mouse Without Borders gained horizontal scrolling support for smoother navigation across devices.
 - Hosts File Editor now lets you configure backup retention settings.

### Advanced Paste
 - Advanced Paste now lets you connect to multiple AI providers instead of being limited to a single OpenAI provider. A new settings page makes it easy to add, remove and select AI services when converting clipboard content (e.g., summarizing or translating text). ([#42374](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42374)).
 - The input box for Advanced Paste has been visually tweaked so that a subtle underline appears when AI assistance is available, giving clearer feedback during editing. ([#43306](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/43306)).

### Awake
 - The Awake countdown timer now stays accurate over long periods and no longer stops after ~50 days. The module uses a single timer to prevent drift and correctly handles long countdowns without prematurely finishing. ([#41684](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/41684)). Thanks Dave Rayment.

### Awake
 - Fixed Awake context menu positioning. The fix removed the conversion of the mouse cursor from screen to client‑window coordinates, instead using the raw screen coordinates returned by GetCursorPos; the context menu now appears at the correct screen position. #41009 Thanks [@lzandman](https://github.com/lzandman)

### Command Palette
 - The search field in context menus now matches the look of the Command Palette, with a smoke backdrop and improved padding. ([#42081](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42081))

 - Fallback items such as math calculations or the Run command now appear in results more quickly. ([#42289](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42289)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Ensures the command bar updates correctly after navigating to another page and commands are displayed correctly. ([#42293](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42293)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - The Command Palette settings page has been reorganized. Activation-key options are grouped under an expander and extension settings are framed for improved readability. ([#42303](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42303))

 - When you modify a command, its alias, hotkey, and tags now update in the top-level list, keeping the displayed information in sync. ([#42806](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42806)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Press `Ctrl + ,` to open Command Palette settings from anywhere. ([#42787](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42787)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - You can use `Page Up` and `Page Down` to navigate the list while focus is in the search box. ([#41886](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/41886)) — Thanks [@samrueby](https://github.com/samrueby).

 - Fixed an issue where the search box could disappear when navigating pages. ([#42783](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42783)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Ensured search text is selected when *Go home when activated* and *Highlight search on activate* are both enabled. ([#42937](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42937)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Fixed an issue where Command Palette window occasionally appeared on the taskbar under certain Windows settings. ([#42902](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42902)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Ensures that labels and icons of list items and menu items update when they change. ([#42982](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42982)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Fixed visibility of list filters when navigating to a content page. ([#42828](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42828)) — Thanks [@DevLGuilherme](https://github.com/DevLGuilherme).

 - Added search to the extension list and a link to extensions on the Microsoft Store. ([#41453](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/41453)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Added options to open the Command Palette window at its last position or re-center it. ([#38943](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/38943))

 - The Command Palette now remembers its window size after restarting. ([#38943](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/38943))

 - Added a global error handler that logs fatal errors and provides feedback when unexpected failures force Command Palette to close. ([#41392](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/41392)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Fixed forms and extension settings not showing on some machines due to a missing VC++ runtime. ([#43255](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/43255))

 - Restored ranking of fallback commands for built-in extensions (Sleep, Shutdown, Windows settings, Web search, etc.). ([#43321](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/43321)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Improved and unified labels and texts across the application. ([#43269](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/43269))

 - Maintainance: Resolved numerous build warnings in Command Palette projects; no user-visible impact. ([#42584](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42584)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Maintainance: Fixed a logging issue so exception messages are properly recorded instead of placeholder text, improving troubleshooting. ([#42460](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42460)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

### Command Palette Extensions
 - Bookmarks: Added hints about bookmark placeholders to the Add/Edit Bookmark form. ([#42793](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42793)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).
 - Bookmarks: Improved migration of bookmarks from older versions and fixed an issue where aliases or keyboard shortcuts could be lost after restart. ([#42814](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42814)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - Clipboard history: Items shown in Command Palette’s clipboard history now include helpful metadata. For example, image items show dimensions, text files show names and sizes, web links include page titles, and text entries display word counts. ([#42188](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42188)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 - File search: Added filter buttons to show *all items*, *files only*, or *folders only*. Selecting a filter adds `kind:folders` or `kind:not folders` to narrow results. ([#42141](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42141))

 - System commands: Replaced the `:red_circle:` placeholder with an actual red-circle emoji so the correct icon appears in the UI. ([#42666](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42666)) — Thanks [@samrueby](https://github.com/samrueby).

 - WinGet: Search performance feels more responsive because typed input is now processed via a task queue rather than complex cancellation tokens. ([#42356](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42356))

 - Window Walker: UWP apps no longer show a “not responding” label when suspended. ([#42317](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42317)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).
 - Window Walker: Now displays the actual icon of each window rather than using the process icon, improving recognition of PWAs and Python GUIs. ([#42316](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42316)) — Thanks [@Lee-WonJun](https://github.com/Lee-WonJun).

- Windows Terminal profiles: Fixed a rare crash in the Windows Terminal extension when the `LOCALAPPDATA` environment variable was missing. The path is now retrieved via a reliable API. ([#42326](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42326)) — Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

### Cursor Wrap
 - A new Cursor Wrap module lets your mouse pointer move seamlessly from one edge of the screen to the opposite edge. It supports up to nine monitors and can wrap across the top, bottom, left and right edges. ([#41826](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/41826)). Thanks Mike Hall.

### Find My Mouse
 - Activating Find My Mouse no longer makes the cursor change to the busy (hourglass) icon or steals focus from your active application. ([#42795](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42795)). 

### Hosts File Editor
 - You can now choose how many backups of the hosts file to keep and how long to keep them, instead of relying on hard-coded backup settings. ([#37778](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/37778)). Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti).

### Image Resizer
 - Fixed Image Resizer settings being reloaded during a batch, improving consistency and performance. #42163 Thanks [@daverayment](https://github.com/daverayment)

### Light Switch
 - Light Switch now includes an **Off** option that disables automatic theme switching while still allowing manual toggles. The module is disabled by default on fresh installs and resets the accent colour when switching back to light mode. It also prevents schedule changes from overriding manual selections and includes several stability fixes. ([#42434](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42434)).

 - When you change your location or switch between schedules (e.g., from sunset/sunrise to specific times), sunrise and sunset times are recalculated immediately and log messages correctly reference dark mode. ([#42774](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42774)). 

 - Light Switch treats changes made in Windows Settings as manual overrides. When you change the scheduled time, it now takes effect immediately rather than waiting for the next cycle. ([#42882](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42882)). 

 - Manual overrides are now cleared even if the schedule boundary is crossed while you were offline. This prevents the theme from staying incorrectly set. ([#43072](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/43072)). 

 - The Light Switch internals were refactored for easier maintenance and to ensure consistent state across manual overrides and scheduled changes. There are no significant user-visible changes. ([#43159](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/43159)).

### Mouse Pointer Crosshairs
 - You can now toggle between the Mouse Pointer Crosshairs and the Gliding Cursor modes. The system remembers the state so that switching back restores the previous behaviour. ([#42105](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42105)). Thanks Mike Hall.

### Mouse Without Borders
 - When using Mouse Without Borders, horizontal scroll gestures now work across devices (when both machines are running the updated version), enabling smoother navigation for wide documents and spreadsheets. ([#42179](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42179)). Thanks [@MasonBergstrom](https://github.com/MasonBergstrom).

### Peek
 - You can now preview files using the Peek utility from the command line or through a named pipe. This makes it possible to integrate Peek into scripts or other tools. ([#38754](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/38754)). Thanks [@prochan2](https://github.com/prochan2).

 - Fixed Peek locking audio/video files. #42055 Thanks [@daverayment](https://github.com/daverayment)

### PowerRename
 - PowerRename no longer crashes due to a missing resources file. The build process now generates the required PRI file automatically. ([#42300](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42300)).
 - PowerRename can extract metadata (e.g., EXIF and XMP) from photos. You can use patterns like `%Camera`, `%Lens`, `%ExposureTime`, and more to rename images based on their properties. ([#41728](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/41728)). 

### PowerToys Run
 - PowerToys Run now suppresses additional Desktop Window Manager and WPF exceptions that previously caused visible error dialogs. The app recovers automatically and logs these errors instead. ([#42588](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/42588)). Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek).

 ### Quick Accent
 - Added the diameter symbol (⌀) to Quick Accent – Quick Accent now offers the Ø/⌀ characters when the special characters language is selected; pressing Shift+O inserts the diameter symbol, meeting a common user request. #42963 thanks to [@anselumjuju](https://github.com/anselumjuju)

### General improvements and infrastructure
 - Build and installer updates: migrated to WiX v5, reduced redundant file copies, zipped group policies, updated installer hashes, unified machine/user installer creation.

 - Bug report generator fix: corrected malformed XML tags.

 - Updated PR prompts and Copilot guidance for contributors.

 - Accessibility and UX tweaks: removed title bars from tab navigation, improved dashboard sorting.

 - Logging enhancements: correct error codes logged, removed PowerToys installer path from system PATH to avoid conflicts.

 - Made the tray‑flyout update notification clickable, making it easier to jump directly to the update options.

 - Added accessible name for the shortcut‑conflict button, so screen readers can now describe the button as "Shortcut conflicts, X conflicts found" instead of announcing only "button".

 - Associated settings controls with their labels, The fix binds each control’s AutomationProperties.Name to the heading text of its settings card so screen readers announce the control's purpose (e.g., "Keep active windows always on top checkbox")

 - Simplified the shortcut‑conflict accessibility logic to reduces complexity and ensure a consistent name regardless of the number of conflicts #43348

### Tests
 - Restored Ctrl + Space activation for Peek UI tests. This ensures tests use a consistent activation key and removes flakiness

 - Added automated UI tests for the Text Extractor. These improvements increase reliability but do not change the user experience. ([#41947](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/41947).

 - Updated the build pipeline to support Windows Server 2022. #43287
