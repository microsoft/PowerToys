# Overview

<img align="right" width="200" src="./doc/images/Logo.jpg">

PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity. Inspired by the [Windows 95 era PowerToys project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys), this reboot provides power users with ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it for individual workflows.  A great overview of the Windows 95 PowerToys can be found [here](https://socket3.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/using-windows-95-powertoys/).

## PowerToy Utilities

### FancyZones

[FancyZones](/src/modules/fancyzones/) - FancyZones is a window manager that makes it easy to create complex window layouts and quickly position windows into those layouts.  The FancyZones backlog can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerToys/tree/master/doc/planning/FancyZonesBacklog.md)

### Shortcut

[Windows key shortcut guide](/src/modules/shortcut_guide) - The shortcut guide appears when a user holds the Windows key down for more than one second and shows the available shortcuts for the current state of the desktop.  The shortcut guide backlog can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerToys/tree/master/doc/planning/ShortcutGuideBacklog.md)

### PowerRename

[PowerRename](/src/modules/powerrename) - PowerRename is a Windows Shell Extension for advanced bulk renaming using search and replace or regular expressions. PowerRename allows simple search and replace or more advanced regular expression matching. While you type in the search and replace input fields, the preview area will show what the items will be renamed to. PowerRename then calls into the Windows Explorer file operations engine to perform the rename. This has the benefit of allowing the rename operation to be undone after PowerRename exits.  

### Version 1.0 plan

Our plan for all the [goals and utilities for v1.0 detailed over here in the wiki](/wiki/Version-1.0-Strategy).

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions of all times. Help spec'ing, design, documentation, finding bugs are ways everyone can help on top of coding features / bug fixes. We are excited to work with the power user community to build a set of tools for helping you get the most out of Windows.

We ask that **before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute**, please read our [Contributor's Guide](contributing.md). We will be happy to work with you to figure out the best approach, provide guidance and mentorship throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.

> ⚠ **Note**: PowerToys is still a nascent project and the team is actively working out of this repository.  We will be periodically re-structuring the code to make it easier to comprehend, navigate, build, test, and contribute to, so **DO expect significant changes to code layout on a regular basis**.
