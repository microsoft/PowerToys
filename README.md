## 📋 Getting started

<details>

<summary>Tips for collapsed sections</summary>

### You can add a header

You can add text within a collapsed section.

You can add an image or a code block, too.

```ruby
   puts "Hello World"
```

</details>

#### System requirements
- Windows 11 or Windows 10 version 2004 (code name 20H1 / build number 19041) or newer.
- x64 or ARM64 processor
- Our installer will install the following items:
   - [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) bootstrapper. This will install the latest version.

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

Go to the [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link] and click on `Assets` at the bottom to show the files available in the release. Please use the appropriate PowerToys installer that matches your machine's architecture and install scope. For most, it is `x64` and per-user.

<!-- items that need to be updated release to release -->

|  Description   | Filename |
|----------------|----------|
| Per user - x64       | [PowerToysUserSetup-0.94.0-x64.exe][ptUserX64] |
| Per user - ARM64     | [PowerToysUserSetup-0.94.0-arm64.exe][ptUserArm64] |
| Machine wide - x64   | [PowerToysSetup-0.94.0-x64.exe][ptMachineX64] |
| Machine wide - ARM64 | [PowerToysSetup-0.94.0-arm64.exe][ptMachineArm64] |

This is our preferred method.

### Via Microsoft Store

Install from the [Microsoft Store's PowerToys page][microsoft-store-link]. You must be using the [new Microsoft Store](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsExperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/), which is available for both Windows 11 and Windows 10.

### Via WinGet
Download PowerToys from [WinGet][winget-link]. Updating PowerToys via winget will respect the current PowerToys installation scope. To install PowerToys, run the following command from the command line / PowerShell:

#### User scope installer [default]
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

#### Machine-wide scope installer

```powershell
winget install --scope machine Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop. If these are your preferred install solutions, you can find the install instructions there.

## Third-Party Run Plugins

There is a collection of [third-party plugins](./doc/thirdPartyRunPlugins.md) created by the community that aren't distributed with PowerToys.

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions of all types. Besides coding features / bug fixes, other ways to assist include spec writing, design, documentation, and finding bugs. We are excited to work with the power user community to build a set of tools for helping you get the most out of Windows.

We ask that **before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute**, please read our [Contributor's Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). We would be happy to work with you to figure out the best approach, provide guidance and mentorship throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.

Most contributions require you to agree to a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][oss-CLA] declaring that you grant us the rights to use your contribution and that you have permission to do so.

For guidance on developing for PowerToys, please read the [developer docs](./doc/devdocs) for a detailed breakdown. This includes how to setup your computer to compile.

## What's Happening

### PowerToys Roadmap

Our [prioritized roadmap][roadmap] of features and utilities that the core team is focusing on.

### 0.94 - Sep 2025 Update

In this release, we focused on new features, stability, optimization improvements, and automation.

For an in-depth look at the latest changes, visit the [release blog](https://aka.ms/powertoys-releaseblog).

**✨Highlights**

 - PowerToys Settings added a Settings search with fuzzy matching, suggestions, a results page, and UX polish to make finding options faster.
 - A comprehensive hotkey conflict detection system was introduced in Settings to surface and help resolve conflicting shortcuts. Note that the default hotkey settings (Win+Ctrl+Shift+T, Win+Ctrl+V, Win+Ctrl+T, Win+Shift+T) may overlap with existing Windows system shortcuts. This is expected. You can resolve the conflict by assigning different hotkeys.
 - Mouse Utilities added a “Gliding cursor” accessibility feature to Mouse Pointer Crosshairs for single‑button cursor movement and clicking. Thanks [@mikehall-ms](https://github.com/mikehall-ms)!
 - The installer was upgraded to WiX 5 after WiX 3 reached end-of-life; this move improved installer security, reliability, and community support.
 - Tons of bug fixes and improvements for Command Palette, including visual updates and new support for filters on ListPages (handy for extension developers).
 - Hosts Editor now has a “No leading spaces” option so active host entries can start at column 0 even if others are disabled. Thanks [@mohammed-saalim](https://github.com/mohammed-saalim)!
 - Context menu registration was moved from the installer to runtime to avoid loading disabled modules (runtime registrations).
 - Quick Accent now supports Maltese, and frequently used accents appear first (and are remembered across sessions). Thanks [@rovercoder](https://github.com/rovercoder)! [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!

### Always On Top

 - Added a local keyboard hook to handle the GoBack key reliably. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Propagated alias changes safely and resolved conflicts across view models.
 - Allowed providers to override Dispose with a virtual method.
 - Fixed memory leaks by cleaning up removed or cancelled list items.
 - Sorted DateTime extension results by relevance for better usability.
 - Reduced search text “jiggling” by avoiding redundant change notifications.
 - Centralized automation notifications in a UIHelper for better accessibility. Thanks [@chatasweetie](https://github.com/chatasweetie)!
 - Preserved Adaptive Card action types during trimming via DynamicDependency.
 - Added an acrylic backdrop and refined styling to the context menu. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
 - Prevented disposed pages and Settings windows from handling stale messages. Thanks [@jiripolasek](https://github.com/jiripolasek)!
