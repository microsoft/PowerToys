This is our preferred method.

### Via Microsoft Store

Install from the [Microsoft Store's PowerToys page][microsoft-store-link]. You must be using the [new Microsoft Store](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsExperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/) which is available for both Windows 11 and Windows 10.

### Via WinGet
Download PowerToys from [WinGet][winget-link]. Updating PowerToys via winget will respect current PowerToys installation scope. To install PowerToys, run the following command from the command line / PowerShell:

#### User scope installer [default]
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

#### Machine-wide scope installer

```powershell
winget install --scope machine Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop. If these are your preferred install solutions, you can find the install instructions there.

## Third-Party Run Plugins

There is a collection of [third-party plugins](./doc/thirdPartyRunPlugins.md) created by the community that aren't distributed with PowerToys.

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions of all types.  Besides  coding features / bug fixes,  other ways to assist include spec writing, design, documentation, and finding bugs. We are excited to work with the power user community to build a set of tools for helping you get the most out of Windows.

We ask that **before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute**, please read our [Contributor's Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). We would be happy to work with you to figure out the best approach, provide guidance and mentorship throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.

Most contributions require you to agree to a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][oss-CLA] declaring that you grant us the rights to use your contribution and that you have permission to do so.

For guidance on developing for PowerToys, please read the [developer docs](/doc/devdocs) for a detailed breakdown. This includes how to setup your computer to compile.

## What's Happening

### PowerToys Roadmap

Our [prioritized roadmap][roadmap] of features and utilities that the core team is focusing on.

### 0.86 - October 2024 Update

In this release, we focused on new features, stability, and improvements.

**Highlights**
 
 - Advanced Paste has new abilities: Image to text, and paste to file (text / png / html).
 - In settings, we've adjusted the left navigation to group the utilities. As the number of utilities shipped with PowerToys keeps growing, we felt this was a needed adjustment. Thanks everyone for your feedback!
 - Workspaces received many bug fixes, including the proper launching of many instances of the same application in the same workspace. Note, we are still actively looking at how to properly handle PWA detection.
 - We've added a diagnostic data (telemetry) opt-in option in the Settings General tab. As it is off-by-default, we encourage users to turn it on as that helps direct our development efforts and their journeys. More information about the data we collect can be found in the [PowerToys Data and Privacy documentation](https://aka.ms/powertoys-data-and-privacy-documentation) and what each event does.

### General

 - Fixed a crash caused by a dangling thread.
 - Clicking a notification about there being an update available should now correctly open the Settings application in the General tab.
 - Fixed a UI freeze when trying to access the Diagnostic Data Viewer files. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!

### Workspaces
