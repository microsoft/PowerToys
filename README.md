### Advanced Paste

 - Fixed an issue where Advanced Paste failed to create the OCR engine for certain English language tags (e.g., en-CA) by initializing the OCR engine with the user profile language. Thanks [@cryolithic](https://github.com/cryolithic)!

### Color Picker

 - Fixed an issue where a resource leak caused hangs or crashes by properly disposing of the Graphics object. Thanks [@dcog989](https://github.com/dcog989)!

 - Updated the Time and Date extension code to simplify it and improve clarity.
 - Fixed an issue where capitalization in the command causes failure when trying to go to the mouse pointer, resolved by adjusting the command to lowercase.
 - Added open URL fallback command for the WebSearch extension, enabling users to directly open URLs in the browser from the Command Palette. Thanks [@htcfreek](https://github.com/htcfreek)!
 - Added setting to enable/disable system tray icon in CmdPal and aligned terminology with Windows 11. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!

 - Fixed a bug in Windows System Command where the key prompt incorrectly displayed "Empty" for the "Open Recycle Bin" action. Thanks [@jironemo](https://github.com/jironemo)!
 - Fixed an issue where the 'more commands' list showed commands that shouldn't be visible. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!

 - Fixed white flash and one-time animation issues in CmdPal by cloaking the window instead of hiding it.
 - Fixed a bug where all extension settings were fetched on startup by lazy-loading extension settings, reducing initialization overhead.
 - Added support for protecting CmdPal from crashes on Adaptive Card parse failure.
 - Replaced shell:AppsFolder with URI activation in CmdPal to improve reliability.
 - Added ability to open CmdPal settings from PowerToys Settings.
