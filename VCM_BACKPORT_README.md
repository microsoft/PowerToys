- PowerToys.admx/adml policy definitions
- Full admin control over VCM feature

### 6. COM Interop

- Spell-check dictionary entries

## Building PowerToys with VCM

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (17.4+)
- Windows 10 SDK (19041 or later)
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- WiX Toolset 3.14 (for installer)

### Build Steps

#### 1. Build the Solution
```powershell
# Open PowerShell in the repo root
cd d:\Programmeerprojecten\GitHub\Forks\PowerToys

# Run the build script (builds everything including VCM)
.\tools\build\build.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64
```

Or build manually in Visual Studio:
1. Open `PowerToys.sln`
2. Set configuration to **Release** and platform to **x64**
3. Build â†’ Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)

#### 2. Build the VCM Proxy Filter x86 (Required for x86 apps)
```powershell
# The x86 proxy filter needs to be built separately
cd src\modules\videoconference\VideoConferenceProxyFilter
msbuild VideoConferenceProxyFilter.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=Win32
```

#### 3. Generate VCM CAB File (For Driver)
```powershell
# Run the CAB generation script
.\tools\build\video_conference_make_cab.ps1
```

#### 4. Build the Installer
```powershell
# Build the installer (includes VCM)
cd installer\PowerToysSetup
msbuild PowerToysInstaller.wixproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

The installer will be in: `installer\PowerToysSetup\bin\Release\PowerToysSetup-x64.msi`

### Quick Build Command
```powershell
# All-in-one build (from repo root)
.\tools\build\build.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64
cd installer\PowerToysSetup
msbuild PowerToysInstaller.wixproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

## Installing PowerToys with VCM

### Option 1: Install from MSI (Recommended)
```powershell
# Run the installer with admin rights
Start-Process "installer\PowerToysSetup\bin\Release\PowerToysSetup-x64.msi" -Verb RunAs
```

The installer will:
1. Install all PowerToys modules including VCM
2. Install the VCM virtual camera driver (requires admin)
3. Register VCM as a virtual camera device
4. Set up all necessary registry entries

### Option 2: Run from Build Output (Development)
```powershell
# Run PowerToys directly from x64\Release
.\x64\Release\PowerToys.exe
```

**Note**: When running from build output, the VCM driver won't be installed automatically. You'll need to manually install it for full functionality.

## Using Video Conference Mute

### First-Time Setup
1. Open PowerToys Settings
2. Navigate to **Video Conference** in the left menu
3. Enable the module
4. Configure your hotkeys:
   - **Mute/Unmute Microphone** (default: Ctrl+Shift+Q)
   - **Turn On/Off Camera** (default: Ctrl+Shift+O)
   - **Both** (default: Ctrl+Shift+B)
5. Choose camera/microphone behavior

### Features
- **System Tray Toolbar**: Shows real-time mute status
- **Global Hotkeys**: Works in any application
- **Virtual Camera**: Can show custom image when camera is off
- **Multi-device Support**: Mutes all microphones simultaneously
- **Visual Feedback**: Toolbar changes based on mute state

### Toolbar Icons
- ðŸŽ¤ Green + ðŸ“¹ Green = Both unmuted
- ðŸŽ¤ Red + ðŸ“¹ Green = Mic muted, camera on
- ðŸŽ¤ Green + ðŸ“¹ Red = Mic on, camera off
- ðŸŽ¤ Red + ðŸ“¹ Red = Both muted

## Troubleshooting

### VCM Not Appearing in Settings
- **Check**: Is `mf.dll` (Media Foundation) available on your system?
- **Solution**: VCM requires Media Foundation. Most Windows 10+ systems have this.
- **Verify**: PowerToys checks for `mf.dll` and `PowerToys.VideoConferenceModule.dll`

### Virtual Camera Not Working
- **Issue**: Driver not installed
- **Solution**: Reinstall PowerToys from MSI with admin rights
- **Manual Install**: Run installer custom action or use device manager

### Build Errors
- **Missing packages**: Run `.\tools\build\build-essentials.ps1` first
- **Platform mismatch**: Ensure you're building x64 for main, x86 for proxy filter
- **WiX not found**: Install WiX Toolset 3.14 from https://wixtoolset.org/

### Driver Signing (For Distribution)
- VCM driver requires code signing for distribution
- Development builds use test signing
- Production requires EV certificate for driver signing

## Known Considerations

### Why VCM Was Deprecated
Microsoft originally deprecated VCM due to:
1. Driver maintenance complexity
2. Limited user adoption
3. Native Teams/Zoom features improving
4. Security/compatibility concerns with virtual camera drivers

### Maintenance Notes
- Virtual camera driver requires updates for new Windows versions
- DirectShow filter needs x86 and x64 builds
- GPO policies need to stay in sync
- Certificate management for driver signing

### Alternative Solutions
Consider if these meet your needs instead:
- Native app hotkeys (Teams, Zoom, Discord)
- Hardware mute buttons on headsets
- Third-party virtual camera apps
